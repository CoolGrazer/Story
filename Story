**Story**
It was a calm evening. The day was sunny and bright. Mike went to his local market to buy some food, little did he know a devasting disaster would occur.
At the market, everything seemed normal. Expect it wasn't. The ground was rumbling just a bit. The floor seemed wet. The clouds as gray as they could be. 
But this didn't botter Mike, he just wanted to get this grocerries. He bought his food from Josh and Jacob, and walked away. The clouds rumbled. The floor dripping. The ground shaking.
This wasn't a odd occurence, but a tsunami. The ground was cracking. Thunder could be heard. The floor was flooded. But this didn't botter Mike. He just went on his merry way. Then, it happened.
As the tsunami hit the Earth, everything toppled over. It was a shock to Mike, but he had nothing to fear. It was but a flash flood, and would be gone in just a couple of seconds. As the water cleared, everyone was in shock. 
But it was fine. Mike walked off, and never spoke of it again.
